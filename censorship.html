	<h2>What is Self-Censorship?</h2>
    <p>Self-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one's own discourse. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority.
     Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film directors, publishers, news anchors, journalists, musicians, and other kinds of authors including individuals who use social media.</p>
    <h2>Freedom of Expression </h2>
    <p>People often communicate to affirm their identity and sense of belonging. People express themselves through their appearance, such as hairstyles and hair color. Shared social norms and beliefs create a sense of belonging, but they can also create a suppression of expression in order to comply or belong.
    There are different factors that contribute to self-censorship, such as gender, age, education, political interests, and media exposure.  </p>
