	<h2>A black woman lost a job offer because she wouldn’t cut her dreadlocks. Now she wants to go to the Supreme Court.</h2>
    <p>"In 2013, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Alabama company, arguing that the HR manager denied Jones a job based on the harmful racial stereotype that African-American hair 
    is naturally unprofessional. The federal district court in Alabama dismissed the claim, saying that racial discrimination must show bias based on traits that a person cannot change, like skin color, and that a hairstyle doesn’t fit into that category because it can be changed. 
    The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court’s ruling in 2016 and then declined to hold a full en banc review of the case in December 2017." (Campbell, 2018)</p>
    <h2>2 Black teens were suspended for wearing their hair in dreadlocks, and now their mothers are suing the school district </h2>
    <p>"DeAndre Arnold, 18, made national headlines after his school suspended him over his hairstyle. He attended the 2020 Oscars as a guest of the actress Gabrielle Union. " (Campbell, 2018)</p>
  	<h2>Louisiana girl sent home from school over braided hair extensions</h2>
    <p> "The girl, Faith Fennidy, has worn her hair in thick braids with extensions to Christ the King Elementary School in Terrytown, Louisiana, for the last two years without any problem, her mother, Montrelle Fennidy, told NBC News affiliate WDSU.
         But Faith was sent home on Monday, and her brother, Steven Evergreen Fennidy, posted video of Faith walking out of school with her family after being told her hairstyle was unacceptable." (Rosenblatt, 2018) </p>
